00:03:35: You say 'Huh? :P'
00:03:38: Gilgamesh says 'stand'
00:03:38: You say 'Rest, right?'
00:03:41: You say 'Oh.'
00:04:17: You say 'Gotta vit.'
00:04:22: Gilgamesh says 'anyone remember the door names'
00:04:34: Ogmar says 'where are we?'
00:04:51: Ogmar says 'nm'
00:04:56: Gilgamesh says 'straight up man'
00:05:06: Gilgamesh says 'bash confuse'
00:05:07: Ogmar says 'i don't remember door names i usually search it out'
00:05:08: Gilgamesh says 'we all here'
00:05:15: Gilgamesh says 'how bout you d'
00:05:16: You say 'warlock huh?'
00:05:17: Ogmar says 'kill 2. and bash man'
00:05:22: You say 'Ready.'
00:06:10: You say 'He loads 2 rings?!'
00:06:14: Ogmar says 'yeah'
00:06:16: You say 'wtf'
00:06:23: Ogmar says 'always has'
00:06:30: You say 'Not before he moved. :S'
00:06:32: Ogmar says 'only full set you can get in game i believe'
00:06:36: You say 'I don't think.'
00:06:39: Ogmar says 'from single mob kill that is'
00:06:46: Sting says 'think i'm out now'
00:06:53: You say 'Granted, I haven't done him since he moved.'
00:07:05: Ogmar group-says 'lost me'
00:07:10: Gilgamesh group-says 'where at?'
00:07:20: Ogmar group-says 'shit few rooms ago'
00:07:27: Ogmar group-says 'where you heading?'
00:07:33: Gilgamesh group-says 'to east ent of spec'
00:07:43: Ogmar group-says 'ok heading there'
00:09:29: Ogmar says 'no hike'
00:09:33: Gilgamesh says 'bugger'
00:09:54: You group-say 'Mutilate Statistics:'
00:10:03: You say 'Didn't have my group set up. :P'
00:10:06: You group-say 'Mutilate Statistics:'
00:10:06: You group-say 'Gilgamesh: 0'
00:10:06: You group-say 'Sting: 0'
00:10:06: You group-say 'Ogmar: 0'
00:10:07: You group-say 'Diabolos: 0'

00:10:31: Gilgamesh says '?'
00:10:33: You say 'An average damage per hit. :P'
00:10:42: Sting says 'ooo'
00:10:48: Gilgamesh says 'can do'
00:10:52: You say 'Add an integer to each character'
00:10:57: You say 'And a function to do the math'
00:11:09: Gilgamesh says 'se'
00:11:10: Gilgamesh says 'sec'
00:14:08: Gilgamesh says 'is / or \ divide'
00:14:25: Sting says '/'
00:14:27: You say 'Uh'
00:14:27: You say '/'
00:14:39: You say 'Make sure they're decimals first. :O'
00:14:43: You say 'Idk how perl works'
00:14:49: You say 'But you might need to multiple them by 1.0'
00:14:56: You say 'Before dividing.'
00:15:17: Sting says 'just uses parentheses :)'
00:15:19: Sting says 'use*'
00:15:37: You say 'Well, in programming, 4 / 3 == 1'
00:15:53: You say 'Integer division always yields an integer.'
00:16:08: You say '4.0 / 3.0 == 1.333'
00:16:08: Sting says 'boo integer division'
00:16:15: Sting says 'float it'
00:16:16: Gilgamesh group-says 'Party Damage Report: '

00:16:26: You say 'I like it. :)'
00:16:30: Sting says 'nice!'
00:16:31: Ogmar says 'cool'
00:17:28: You say 'I need to add that stuff to my group reporting.'
00:17:38: You say 'Before I do that, I need to make a way to update my group members without purging the collection.'
00:17:39: Gilgamesh says 'do you capture all the hits yet?'
00:17:46: You say 'Nah. Just mutilates.'
00:17:59: You say 'I was trying to watch how much regex I did, because I didn't wanna bog it down.'
00:18:08: You say 'But this shit is still fast, and I've added a lot.'
00:18:18: You say 'Refined a lot of my original ones now that I know regex fairly well'
00:18:18: Gilgamesh says 'i haven't had any problem'
00:18:23: You say 'So they require less passes, and are more accurate'
00:18:26: Gilgamesh says 'and ive got a fair amount of regexp'
00:18:38: You say 'And since I got all the BOMs and ansi color codes stripped, I can anchor everything as well.'
00:19:07: Gilgamesh says 'i luckily dont have to bother stripping :)'
00:19:12: You say 'I was afraid it was my regex causing JMC 3.7.1.0 to bog down, but it appears it was just a bug there.'
00:19:30: You say 'A simple extension/prototype solved that.'
00:19:38: You say 'Of course, by simple I mean "took me hours to figure out"'
00:20:27: You say 'So I guess I have functions to add/remove members manually.'
00:20:40: You say 'I'd really like to just have it "update" the group when you type group.'
00:20:51: You say 'Remove members who aren't there, add new ones.'
00:20:55: Ogmar says 'afk a sec'
00:21:06: Gilgamesh says 'that doesn't sound so hard'
00:21:29: Gilgamesh says 'i track all my group members anyway'
00:21:34: You say 'It shouldn't be, but I may need to maintain a "temporary" collection of names.'
00:21:40: You say 'And compare it to the existing collection.'
00:22:25: You say 'Ew, that regex got updated heavily.'
00:22:32: You say 'Originally I was capturing the line.'
00:22:34: You say 'Then splitting on the --'
00:22:40: You say 'And stripping of the "(head of group)'
00:22:51: You say 'Had no idea how well regex could work in that situation :P'
00:23:01: Gilgamesh says 'i use a wait coroutine'
00:23:22: Ogmar says 'back'
00:23:48: Gilgamesh says 'basically, i give it captures criteria i specify'
00:23:53: Gilgamesh says 'until a condition is met'
00:24:05: Gilgamesh says 'which is usually a blank line'
00:24:19: Gilgamesh says 'everything is then saved into a table'
00:24:22: You say 'For things like practice sessions, I had to get tricky.'
00:24:31: Sting says 'i'm think i'm done for the night'
00:24:32: You say 'I had to define 2 boolean values.'
00:24:36: Gilgamesh says 'ill head to glob'
00:24:39: Gilgamesh says 'think i am too'
00:24:41: You say 'Am I looking for practice sessions, and have I found practice sessions.'
00:24:43: Gilgamesh says 'can divvy up gear there'
00:24:47: You say 'Because that blank line can pop up sometimes.'
00:25:01: Ogmar says 'can i get sac?'
00:25:06: Sting says 'of balls?'
00:25:07: Gilgamesh says 'sure'
00:25:13: Ogmar says 'yes balls'
00:25:58: You say 'I think tomorrow I'll expand the group thing to do hits/damage.  You did a good implementation, and I like it.'
00:26:29: Gilgamesh says 'i started off with mute count too'
00:26:37: Gilgamesh says 'but when light fighting spec gets the change'
00:26:46: Gilgamesh says 'im interested more in party damage output'
00:26:58: Gilgamesh says 'i also track mobs'
00:26:59: Gilgamesh says '229 mobs killed, 82 different mob types'
00:27:02: You say 'Makes sense.  MUT count was for the thrill'
00:27:05: Gilgamesh says 'To level: 65,883 XP (2 h) 243 average kills. (35,513 XP/hour)'
00:27:12: You say 'But seeing average damage output per hit'
00:27:20: Ogmar says 'anyone sticking around?'
00:27:21: You say 'I'd love to put timers on them as well, and do hits per second.'
00:27:25: You say 'Or hits per minute.'
00:27:39: Sting says 'per second would be best prolly'
00:28:04: You say 'It's hard to track though, because you'd really need to know the state of fighting vs not fighting.'
00:28:13: Gilgamesh says 'and you cant be sure of that'
00:28:27: Gilgamesh says 'unless you reset their state after a kill'
00:28:34: Gilgamesh says 'but if you are both fighitng different mobs'
00:28:38: You say 'And start it when they attack.'
00:28:43: You say 'But turning mobs is hard.'
00:28:48: Gilgamesh says 'it is'
00:28:50: Gilgamesh says 'ok'
00:28:51: Gilgamesh says 'so gear'
00:28:52: You say 'Cause then they're getting rescued, and regenerating energy'
00:29:04: Gilgamesh says 'wwf, ww heart'
00:29:07: Gilgamesh says 'blue robe'
00:29:08: You say 'and B&G boots.'
00:29:11: Gilgamesh says 'serp hammer'
00:29:13: Gilgamesh says 'cup'
00:29:20: Gilgamesh says 'wolf fur'
00:29:22: Gilgamesh says 'cowl'
00:29:26: Ogmar says 'i want to roll on robe for lowb and spider sac'
00:30:01: You say 'groll? Or individual rolls?'
00:30:28: You say 'I'd like robe.  If it's that important to Ogmar, he can take it.'
00:30:46: Ogmar says 'nah go for it'
00:30:58: You say 'Does your lowbie have anything right now?'
00:31:19: Ogmar says 'umm yeah some hand me downs, i'm leasurly leveling him'
00:31:21: Sting says 'i guess i'll get heart'
00:31:23: Ogmar says 'not a requirement right now'
00:31:35: Sting says 'and i'm out for rest'
00:31:36: Ogmar says 'he's 9'
00:31:38: Ogmar says 'thanks'
00:31:45: Sting says 'thanks for the group guys'
00:31:49: You say 'Thank you stinger'
00:31:49: Gilgamesh says 'got two stone rings here also'
00:31:55: Gilgamesh says 'cheers sting'
00:32:46: You say 'erm, still have shinies, B&G boots, sapphirine'

00:33:37: Gilgamesh says 'cowl, furs still here'
00:33:54: Gilgamesh says 'and got a lucern hammer if someone wants a tarnished sickle'
00:33:57: Ogmar says 'i'd say just hold for lowbs'
00:34:09: Ogmar says 'trad that hammer in for sick to drop weight'
00:34:18: Ogmar says 'ooozing is best'
00:34:21: Gilgamesh says 'i cbf running up there'
00:35:12: Ogmar says 'cbf?'
00:35:20: Ogmar says 'D are you renting?'
00:35:21: Gilgamesh says 'couldn't be fucked'
00:35:22: You say 'cbf?'
00:35:31: You say 'I may be, unsure.'
00:35:46: Ogmar says 'well if you want to xp some i'll be around for a bit'
00:35:54: Ogmar says 'think i'm about to step outside the house for a sec'
00:36:02: Ogmar says 'afk a min and i'll be back'
00:36:06: Ogmar says 'thanks for group G'
