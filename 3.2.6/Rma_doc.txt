                                  RMUD (telnet://rmud.techno.ru:4000)

  RMA is freeware. You can distribute it in any way, but this file
  (rma_doc.txt) and executable one (rma.exe) must not be separated.

  This version of RMA is distributed within JMC MUD client by Sergey Ilin.
  It can be used to view RMA LOG files generated by JMC or RMUD server.
  To view such file, just type: rma.exe [filename]. You can run rma.exe
  with no parameters to read the help.

  What is RMA? Basically, it is simple ANSI player with one new code added:
  [ESC]p:[millisecs]m  , where [ESC] is escape code
                               [millisecs] amount of time to pause

  RMA gives you an ability to view MUD logs (battles, challenges etc) in
  full realism, with colors and pauses. Give it a try and you will surely
  like it.
