20:23:39: You say 'But the switch block where it's applied.'
20:23:41: Gilgamesh says 'thats what im going off'
20:23:46: You say 'Says anything above 90 damage == MUTILATE message.'
20:24:03: You say 'And in the combat system, damage is capped at 200 in a funky way.'
20:24:21: You say 'Where if damage exceeds 220, it's restricted to 200'
20:24:27: You say 'So max damage should be 219.'

20:27:43: You say 'Seether's shield, Fingolfin's shield'
20:27:47: You say 'And the current shield.'
20:27:47: Gilgamesh says 'how does the logic process it'
20:28:20: You say 'The code for processing damage is very basic.  Apply resistances, sanc, all that good stuff.'
20:28:27: You say 'If the attack is still going to land.'
20:28:48: You say 'Then check to see what the damage is.'
20:28:55: You say 'If it exceeds 230, roll is back to 200.'
20:29:15: Gilgamesh says 'and in the case of mute, how does it process above 120'
20:29:19: Gilgamesh says 'msg wise'
20:29:22: Ogmar says 'getting water and food'
20:29:35: You say 'Of'
20:29:39: You say 'So it's a switch block'
20:29:49: You say 'er'
20:29:51: You say 'if/else'
20:30:08: You say 'if damage == 0, msgnumber 0, if damage <= 1, msgnmbr1'
20:30:21: You say 'else if dmg <= 90, msgnum9, otherwise msgnum10'
20:30:32: You say 'Left out a few in there. :P'
20:30:45: You say 'Trying to hunt down where this function is called'
20:30:51: You say 'Because perhaps it is filtered down before being called.'
20:30:53: Gilgamesh says 'thats a sev'
20:30:56: Gilgamesh says 'what above for mute'
20:31:02: You say '<= 90 is a sev'
20:31:04: You say 'MUT is 91+'
20:31:13: You say 'which is msgnum10'
20:31:18: You say 'Which is a MUT.'
20:31:32: You say 'So if it's > 90, it's a MUT is how the array is called.'
20:31:39: Gilgamesh says 'because unless there is another else at the end, it would error above 120'
20:31:42: Gilgamesh says 'oh'
20:31:52: Gilgamesh says 'its not explicit for 90-120'
20:31:57: You say 'Just > 90'
20:32:00: Gilgamesh says 'ahh'
20:32:04: Gilgamesh says 'that makes more sense'
20:32:06: You say 'So the comments definitely say 90-120'
20:32:12: You say 'But it's not executed in that way.'
20:32:22: Gilgamesh group-says 'Party Damage Report: '
20:32:22: Gilgamesh group-says 'A white tiger: Damage output (8841)'
20:32:22: Gilgamesh group-says 'Diabolos: Damage output (30)'
20:32:23: Gilgamesh group-says 'Gilgamesh: Damage output (3903)'
20:32:23: Gilgamesh group-says 'Ogmar: Damage output (8936)'
20:32:23: Gilgamesh group-says 'Sting: Damage output (0)'
20:32:29: Gilgamesh says 'ooh, in the lead OG'
20:32:48: Gilgamesh group-says 'outside sting'
20:32:50: Ogmar says 'Heavy ftw'
20:32:57: You say 'I need Matt to get back on, so I can get my tells from him to track my damage. :P'
20:33:13: Gilgamesh says 'lol'
20:33:20: Gilgamesh says 'trust me it will be bad :p'
20:33:22: Ogmar says 'so where we heading'
20:33:30: Gilgamesh says 'save of 5 and above is rough'
20:33:36: Gilgamesh says 'was thinking mauglir'
20:34:05: Gilgamesh says 'sec'
20:34:17: You say 'So the damage ranges are: 0-0, 1-1, 2-3, 4-6, 5-11, 12-17, 18-24, 25-33, 34-60, 61-90, 91+'
20:34:30: You say 'er, 7-11.'
20:34:35: Gilgamesh says 'for smaller than mute, im taking middle values'
20:34:55: You say 'Those should be relatively on point until you hit sevs.'
20:35:15: You say 'Actually, sev range is only 2-3 more than deeply range.'
20:35:33: You say 'I'm surprised at how large the ranges are for above a normal hit as opposed to below.'
20:35:44: Gilgamesh says 'i was too'
20:35:51: Gilgamesh says 'but it makes sense'
20:35:59: Gilgamesh says 'you some deeplies look amazing'
20:36:05: Gilgamesh says 'others, terrible'
20:36:10: You say 'Yeah.'
20:36:21: You say 'I wish it was still OBLITERATE :('
20:36:27: Gilgamesh says 'lol'
20:36:32: Gilgamesh says 'just use subs'
20:36:49: You say 'I think the damage ranges were different when obliterates were around.'
20:36:54: You say 'Obliterates fell into the current sev range.'
20:37:13: Sting says 'beep me if we do anything big'
20:37:44: You say 'Kenny went on a date.  His dog is crying up a storm.'
20:37:50: Gilgamesh says 'lol'
20:37:58: You group-say 'Lost me. :P'
20:38:06: Gilgamesh group-says 'at cavedrake'
20:38:31: You say 'Nice sickle. :)'
20:38:36: You say 'sec'
20:38:49: Ogmar says 'sickle rocks!'
20:38:56: You say 'Had to fill flasks :O'
20:39:02: Gilgamesh says 'got myself another yesterday'
20:39:04: Ogmar says 'got drognet from 50-80 before he got a pale blade'
20:39:10: Gilgamesh says 'while i was refreshing my brain with ang'
20:39:31: You say 'I'm beginning to dislike JMC 3.7.1'
20:39:34: You say '3.7.0*'
20:39:41: Gilgamesh says 'because'
20:39:44: You say 'They decreased the buffer on the client, it seems.'
20:39:54: You say 'So when you examine a large bag, for example'
20:39:57: Gilgamesh says 'mushclient'
20:39:59: You say 'The lines get split up'
20:40:19: You say 'All of my work is based around JMC and tintin core. :O'
20:40:25: Gilgamesh says 'i know :p'
20:40:32: You say 'Which, may I add, I hate tintin core.'
20:40:40: You say 'I should have proceeded building my own mud client.'
20:40:47: You say 'But getting some of the features working would have been gruesome.'
20:41:09: You say 'Aliases would be an easy implementation, and may exist.'
20:41:18: You say 'If I skipped the front end trigger language'
20:41:20: Ogmar says 'hold'
20:41:24: You say 'And worked off of a compiler'
20:41:35: You say 'I could probably do some C# script, JScript, and VBScript'
20:41:47: You say 'C# script would be amazing.'
20:42:23: You say 'Omg now that I'm thinking about it, it'd be easy to implement.'
20:44:34: Gilgamesh says 'mush can use VBscript, JScript, PerlScript, Tcl, Python, Lua, TCL and PHPscript.'
20:45:03: You say 'So I wouldn't even need to limit it to a scripting language.'
20:45:08: You say 'I could compile C# and VB on the fly. :D'
20:45:19: You say 'Already do it at work.  MS has a framework for it.'
20:45:43: You say 'Just have to implement an interface on it... which would most likely consist of the event handlers.'
20:45:55: You say 'OnReceived, OnSend, OnConnected, etc.'
20:48:42: Gilgamesh says 'he moves like cowled :s'
20:49:21: Gilgamesh says 'ill do it later'
20:51:58: You say 'Wow, I see why Dave hates this combat system.'
20:52:50: Gilgamesh says 'its an "abomination"'
20:53:09: You say 'It really is.'
20:53:13: You say 'It's all over the damage place.'
20:53:16: You say 'damn*'
20:53:32: Gilgamesh says 'he has/is writing his own correct?'
20:53:35: You say 'I really hate when people do 2 line if statements with no brackets. :('
20:53:42: Gilgamesh says 'ewww'
20:53:47: You say 'He hasn't started yet, it's a huge undertaking and he's pretty tied up for the summer.'
20:53:59: You say 'He's dropping his thursday night trivia which is twice a month.'
20:54:07: Gilgamesh says 'oh dang'
20:54:12: You say 'Which should free him up 2 nights a week to program. :P'
20:54:15: You say 'month*'
20:54:17: Gilgamesh says 'lol'
20:54:30: You say 'But during the summer, he's all over.  He is leaving for Ocean City tomorrow, I believe.'
20:54:42: Ogmar says 'on assist trig, afk a sec getting a drink'
20:57:03: Ogmar says 'back'
20:57:18: Gilgamesh says 'rest'
20:57:52: Gilgamesh group-says 'come'

21:00:27: Gilgamesh says 'naurig i think'
21:00:33: You say 'I'll go chill wise'
21:00:36: You say 'To try and save you some hp'

21:02:35: Gilgamesh says 'think so'
21:02:38: Gilgamesh says 'but you cant see it'
21:02:51: Gilgamesh says 'so'
21:02:53: You say 'Mauglir drops key, right?'
21:02:54: Gilgamesh says 'this the plan'
21:03:14: Gilgamesh says 'i will attack magi'
21:03:21: Gilgamesh says 'D and O will assist me'
21:03:34: Gilgamesh says 'O will then bash mauglir'
21:03:50: Gilgamesh says 'sting, you job is to hal mauglir'
21:03:56: Gilgamesh says 'and confuse'
21:03:58: You say 'Hmmm.'
21:04:01: Gilgamesh says 'by the time you do that'
21:04:05: You say 'Are you attacking magi, gilga?'
21:04:16: Gilgamesh says 'if you unload on magi first'

21:06:19: Gilgamesh says 'you prolly wont need to'
21:06:26: Gilgamesh says 'they should all assist to attack me'
21:06:32: Gilgamesh says 'you might eat the odd spell'
21:06:35: You say 'The main source of their damage is painful spells, I'd say.'
21:06:38: Ogmar says 'ready when you are'
21:06:44: Sting says 'rdy'
21:07:18: Gilgamesh says 'going in 3'
21:08:20: You say 'Good confuse. :)'
21:08:46: You say 'er, sec'
21:09:45: You say 'Well that stinks.  I thought studded would at least be the same. :/'
21:10:24: Ogmar says 'whats next'
21:10:35: Gilgamesh says 'im open to suggestions'
21:11:25: You say 'Heh.'
21:11:32: You say 'So before a hit is determined to land'
21:11:40: You say 'A random number between 1 and 35 is rolled.'
21:11:49: You say 'If the number is 35, you get +100 OB for that hit.'
21:11:58: Gilgamesh says 'lol wtf'
21:12:10: You say 'Which is a "guaranteed hit"'
21:12:45: Gilgamesh says 'so, do you guys need anything?'
21:12:55: Sting says 'not really'
21:13:02: Ogmar says 'str hike'
21:13:12: Gilgamesh says 'what metal you got D?'
21:13:56: Ogmar says 'you guys want to do ice or something'
21:14:01: You say 'OB = OB + random number between 1 and (OB/4+55), + random number between 1-35, - ob/8, -40, (+ 0 if random number was < 35, otherwise + 100)'
21:14:10: Gilgamesh says 'fear bodyguard'
21:14:36: Ogmar says 'feared him'
21:14:42: Gilgamesh says 'he was scared'

21:16:04: Gilgamesh says 'ppl may want to rollon robe'
21:16:17: You say 'They can roll on shield as well.  I'm not stingy.'
21:16:22: Ogmar says 'i have a mage i'm trying to level that could use it so i'd roll on it'
21:16:22: Gilgamesh says 'that kite shield you are wearing rubs me the wrong way'
